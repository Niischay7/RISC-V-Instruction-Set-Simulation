# RISC-V Assembler and Simulator

This project includes an assembler and a simulator for the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). The assembler converts RISC-V assembly code into machine code, and the simulator executes the machine code to simulate the behavior of a RISC-V processor.

## Features

- **Assembler**: Converts RISC-V assembly instructions into 32-bit binary machine code.
- **Simulator**: Executes the machine code and simulates the behavior of a RISC-V processor, including register and memory operations.
- **Support for RISC-V Instructions**: Supports R-type, I-type, S-type, B-type, U-type, and J-type instructions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

### Assembler

To convert RISC-V assembly code into machine code, use the following command:

```sh
python3 assembler.py input_file output_file
```

- `input_file`: Path to the input assembly code file.
- `output_file`: Path to the output machine code file.

### Simulator

To simulate the execution of the machine code, use the following command:

```sh
python3 simulator.py input_file output_file
```

- `input_file`: Path to the input machine code file.
- `output_file`: Path to the output file where the simulation results will be stored.

## Input File Format

The input assembly code file should contain RISC-V assembly instructions, one per line. For example:

```assembly
add x1, x2, x3
sub x4, x5, x6
lw x7, 0(x8)
```

## Output File Format

The output machine code file will contain the 32-bit binary representation of the assembly instructions, one per line. For example:

```
00000000001100000001000010000011
00000000001100000001000100000011
00000000000000000001000110000111
```

The output simulation file will contain the state of the registers and memory after each instruction is executed.

## Example

### Assembly Code (input.asm)

```assembly
add x1, x2, x3
sub x4, x5, x6
lw x7, 0(x8)
```

### Machine Code (output.bin)

```
00000000001100000001000010000011
00000000001100000001000100000011
00000000000000000001000110000111
```

### Simulation Output (output.txt)

```
0b00000000000000000000000000000000 0b00000000000000000000000000000000 0b00000000000000000000000000000000 ...
